# ðŸ§¬ PCOS Data Analysis Project

This project investigates the potential relationships between **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** and several factors, including **weight**, **genes**, **stress**, **mental health**, **exercise**, **vegetarianism**, and **sleep measures**. The analysis was performed entirely using **Microsoft Excel**, incorporating **scatter plots**, **bar plots**, and **Slicers** for interactive data filtering.

The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**, and it includes various lifestyle and health factors that might influence PCOS symptoms.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

### Objectives:
- Analyze the relationship between **weight** and **PCOS severity**.
- Investigate how **genetic factors** might influence PCOS.
- Examine the effects of **stress** and **mental health** on PCOS.
- Study the **benefits of exercise** in managing PCOS.
- Explore the relationship between **sleep quality** and **PCOS symptoms**.
- Assess if being a **vegetarian** affects PCOS severity.

## ðŸ“¦ Data and Methodology

### Data Source:
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from **Kaggle** and contains information from individuals diagnosed with PCOS. The dataset includes the following variables:
- **Weight**: Body weight (kg).
- **Genes**: Genetic markers (if available).
- **Stress**: Stress levels (self-reported).
- **Mental Health**: Mental health status (self-reported).
- **Exercise**: Frequency of exercise and perceived benefits of exercise on health.
- **Sleep Measures**: Information on sleep quality and duration.
- **Vegetarianism**: Whether the individual follows a vegetarian diet.

### Analysis Methodology:
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
   - Standardized units (e.g., weight in kilograms) to ensure uniformity.

2. **Visualization**:
   - **Scatter Plots**: Created to explore relationships between **weight**, **exercise**, **sleep**, and **PCOS severity**.
   - **Bar Plots**: Used to compare categorical factors such as **mental health**, **stress levels**, and **vegetarianism** with PCOS occurrence.
   
3. **Excel Functions**:
   - Used functions such as **AVERAGE**, **CORREL**, **COUNTIF**, and **VLOOKUP** to analyze and summarize the data.

4. **Interactive Slicers**:
   - **Slicers** were used in Excel to create an interactive environment, allowing users to filter the data based on variables like **exercise**, **mental health**, **stress levels**, and **sleep quality**. These slicers make it easier to visualize how these factors influence PCOS across different subgroups of data.

## ðŸš€ Project Execution

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate rows.
- **Missing Values**: Handled missing data by replacing or deleting entries.
- **Data Standardization**: Ensured that all measurements were in a consistent format (e.g., weight in kilograms).

### 2. Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Scatter Plots**:
  - Created scatter plots to visualize the relationships between continuous variables, such as **weight** and **PCOS severity**, and **exercise benefits** with PCOS.
  - **Sleep quality** and **sleep duration** were also analyzed using scatter plots to see their impact on PCOS symptoms.
  
- **Bar Plots**:
  - Bar plots were used to explore the relationship between **mental health**, **stress**, **exercise frequency**, and **PCOS**.
  - **Vegetarianism** was compared against PCOS occurrence using bar charts.

- **Slicers**:
  - Interactive **Slicers** were added to the Excel file, allowing users to filter the data based on specific criteria, such as **exercise frequency**, **mental health status**, **sleep quality**, and **stress levels**.
  - Slicers enhance the usability of the dataset, enabling deeper analysis based on various subsets of data.

### 3. Key Findings
- **Weight**: There is a moderate positive correlation between **weight** and **PCOS severity**. Higher body weight tends to correlate with more severe symptoms.
- **Exercise**: Regular exercise was found to have a positive impact on managing PCOS, with those who exercised frequently reporting fewer symptoms.
- **Sleep Measures**: Better **sleep quality** and **longer sleep duration** were associated with lower PCOS severity, indicating that sleep is an important factor in managing PCOS.
- **Stress**: High **stress** levels were correlated with increased PCOS severity, suggesting stress may exacerbate symptoms.
- **Vegetarianism**: While no strong correlation between **vegetarianism** and PCOS was found, lifestyle habits like diet and exercise remain crucial for managing the condition.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Scatter Plots**: Used to analyze continuous relationships such as **weight**, **sleep**, and **exercise** with PCOS severity.
- **Bar Plots**: Used to compare categorical factors like **stress**, **mental health**, and **vegetarianism** with PCOS occurrence.
- **Slicers**: Used for interactive filtering, allowing users to segment the data based on variables like **exercise**, **stress**, **sleep**, and **mental health**.
